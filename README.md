# todo-List

This is a simple to-do list website. The project is one of my old projects that I decided to rewrite and make available on my GitHub. Please note that this to-do list website is a basic implementation, and there are many other better alternatives like [Trello](https://trello.com/) or similar platforms.

This website has the following features:

- Add tasks to the list.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Tasks are sorted alphabetically and numerically (if applicable).
- Clear all tasks with a single click.
