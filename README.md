# todo-list

This is a simple to-do list website. The project is one of my old projects that
I decided to rewrite and make available on my GitHub.

This website has the following features:

  - Add tasks to the list.
  - Remove tasks from the list.
  - Tasks are sorted alphabetically and numerically (if applicable).
  - Clear all tasks with a single click.
